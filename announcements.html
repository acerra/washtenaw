WINTER REMINDERS
As the winter and holiday seasons approach, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following
reminders:
SNOW REMOVAL
Trigon Inc (Emir) completes snow removal services for snowfalls of ONE INCH or more. Upon accumulation
of less than one inch, Emir will apply salt/calcium chloride with limited shoveling. In most instances, Emir
will clear entryways and salt the walks and driveways on his next regularly scheduled shift or within 24-
hours on the weekend.
HOLIDAY TRAVEL
If you are traveling during the holidays, remember to leave your heat set no lower than 55 degrees to
prevent freezing/burst pipes.
CHRISTMAS TREES
Remember to be courteous bringing in and removing Christmas trees. Please only transport trees in a tree
bag to avoid scuffing walls or leaving needles in the carpet. In an effort to stop the dumpsters from
becoming quickly filled with large and bulky Christmas trees, please consider recycling your tree with the
City of Chicago.
HOLIDAY PLUMBING USE
The holiday season can be especially rough on the plumbing system in the building. Increased or improper
use of kitchen drains and garbage disposals can lead to unnecessarily clogged common drain lines and
back-ups. Please be sure to limit the materials put through garbage disposals.
In particular, please do not put food scraps, meat fats, cooking oils, lard, baked goods, salad dressings,
sauces, marinades, dairy products, shortening, butter and margarine, coffee grinds, eggshells, grain, rice,
seeds, etc. All of these items quickly contribute to a buildup in the drain lines.
FURNACE MAINTENANCE
Before the weather turns too cold, please consider having your furnace serviced by a licensed HVAC
contractor. Preventative maintenance can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your furnace,
and can also identify and resolve problems before they cause a disruption in service. Please contact your
Asst. Community Manager for a recommended HVAC contractor.
Additionally, please remember to regularly inspect and replace the air filter in your furnace (every 30-60
days). A dirty filter can drastically reduce efficiency and shorten the life of your furnace.
HOLIDAY PACKAGE DELIVERY
It is typical for an increase in package delivery this time of year. It is strongly recommended that you have
parcels either delivered to your place of work or require a signature for delivery. An accumulation of
packages in a building lobby or vestibule is not only visually unappealing, it is also an invitation to thieves.
Please make sure to collect delivered packages on a daily basis.

HOLIDAY CLEAN-UP
All trash must be placed within the provided containers. Excessive garbage in and around the Association

recycling dumpsters.
